This is an API app based on API on Rails book walk through. Several bugs that were present in the book have been fixed here, along with a few code improvements. I also decided to use jbuilder instead of AMS.

The chapters are divided into branches.

- [Setting Up](https://github.com/abitdodgy/market_place_api/tree/2-setting-api)
- [Presenting the Users](https://github.com/abitdodgy/market_place_api/tree/3-presenting-the-users)
- [Refactoring Tests](https://github.com/abitdodgy/market_place_api/tree/4-refactoring-tests)
- [Authenticating Uses](https://github.com/abitdodgy/market_place_api/tree/5-authenticating-users)
- [User Products](https://github.com/abitdodgy/market_place_api/tree/6-user-products)
- [Placeing Orders](https://github.com/abitdodgy/market_place_api/tree/8-placing-orders)

If you are looking for something faithful to the book, you might want to look else where. The code base takes us all the way to the end, and is feature complete along with my own tests that were not present in the book.

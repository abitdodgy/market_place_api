This is an API app based on, but not identical to, the API on Rails book. Several bugs that were present in the book are fixed, along with a many code improvements. I decided to use jbuilder instead of AMS.

Building this app was a lot of fun, and API feel light-weight. In that, they're a lot easier to work with than apps that span the entire stack. You don't have to worry about the front-end layer, allowing you to focus on writing great controllers and fabulous models!

The chapters are divided into branches.

- [Setting Up](https://github.com/abitdodgy/market_place_api/tree/2-setting-api)
- [Presenting the Users](https://github.com/abitdodgy/market_place_api/tree/3-presenting-the-users)
- [Refactoring Tests](https://github.com/abitdodgy/market_place_api/tree/4-refactoring-tests)
- [Authenticating Uses](https://github.com/abitdodgy/market_place_api/tree/5-authenticating-users)
- [User Products](https://github.com/abitdodgy/market_place_api/tree/6-user-products)
- [Placeing Orders](https://github.com/abitdodgy/market_place_api/tree/8-placing-orders)

If you are looking for something faithful to the book, you might want to look elsewhere. The code base takes us all the way to the end, and is feature complete along with my own additional tests that were not present in the book.
